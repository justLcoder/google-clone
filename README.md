# Google Search Clone

## 📖 About This Project

This project is a hands-on attempt to recreate the Google homepage from scratch.

Instead of copying visually only, the goal was to understand how real interfaces are structured — including layout systems, state management, autocomplete behavior, and theme persistence.

The project focuses on writing clean, framework-free HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
